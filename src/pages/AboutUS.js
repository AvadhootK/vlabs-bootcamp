        <h2>Virtual Labs</h2>
        Virtual Labs is an initiative of the Ministry of Education (MoE), Govt.
        of India, under the National Mission on Education through ICT. The main
        objective of VLABS is to provide a complete Learning Management System
        around the Virtual Labs where the students can perform laboratory
        experiments online in an interactive and engaging manner on a simulator
        and seek an improved insight of the fundamentals through simulations,
        animated demonstrations, lab manual, and self-evaluation-pre-test and
        post-test type of formative assessment

        <h2>About BootCamp</h2>
        Virtual Labs project aims to develop Virtual Experiments for the science
        and engineering disciplines. There are over 1000 experiments developed
        and hosted in the recent past. However, with more than 700 universities
        in the country, there is a need to develop more content to fill the
        syllabus gap. Towards these efforts, the VLabs IITB team has extended
        the development efforts with its partners (Nodal centers) to expedite
        the content creation. This involves creating a. Ideation boards and b.
        Coding for the ready Ideation to develop the simulator. This event is
        aimed at developing the simulator for the existing Ideations in various
        science and engineering domains with the help of the student and teacher
        community. About the event: The coding Bootcamp is open for the
        students. It is going to be a two-week hybrid event. The participation
        is based on a qualification test submission, which the potential
        participants need to qualify. The two-week-long event will involve
        training and content development to build virtual labs. The developed
        content is going to be beta-hosted on the VLabsDev server and will be
        visible with the credits to all contributors.
